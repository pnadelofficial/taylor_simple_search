likely to be greater than the 0 _ 068 indicated in the two small transfusion studies _ Injecting drug misusers 6 The largest group at risk of carrying hepatitis C will be injecting drug users both current users and those who may have injected drugs in the past , sometimes the distant past and only for a short period_ There is evidence to suggest that perhaps between 50-808 of intravenous arug users will test positive for anti-HCV _ Rates vary with geographical area 7 The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) are taking an active interest in HCV in injecting drug users with some of its members pressing for testing for all past and present users _ They are asking DH to arrange a days workshop SO that the issues can be fully discussed _ Although the number of injecting drug users (both past and present ) is not known_ one ACMD member who has been active in organising a survey of test results performed by drug treatment agencies in various parts of the country and who is pressing for more treatment for those found positive_ laid before ACMD a paper which estimated that the number of intravenous drug users that may have been infected with HCV in the UK could be around 400 , 000-500 , 000 _ How this figure was derivea was not explained_ 8 , The Health of the Nation Area Handbook: HIV AIDS and Sexual Health states in para 4.1.4 , \"The preliminary results of the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles show that less than 18 of the population reported having injected drugs (other than those medically prescribed) in the last five years a total of roughly 100 , 000 in England and Wales _ More than half of these reported sharing equipment _ These figures are only for the last five years and will not include those who may have injected 10-15 years ago when sharing of equipment may have been higher before needle exchange schemes existea and before the risks of HIV transmission were appreciated_ 9 Whichever way this is looked at there may be well over 100,000 intravenous drug users infected with HCV with increasing pressure for testing of this group and referral for treatment _ The survey referred to above showed there was difficulty in obtaining tests Key\\nin some areas and of the onward referral for treatment of many of those found to be positive _ Lookback testing and treatment of blood recipients will raise expectations amongst those pressing for testing and treatment of drug misusers Intravenous drug users would place the heaviest burden on resources for testing and treatment One ACMD member has called for ring fenced monies to treat HCV in drug misusers _ Haemodialysis units 10 _ The prevalence of anti-HCV is raised in those undergoing renal haemodialysis with rates varying between 48 and 478 in studies around the world _ Higher figures relate to countries where the underlying prevalence of hepatitis C in the population is high and where infection control procedures may not be good _ Accuracy of some data may be questioned because insensitive assays were used _ Most studies show a relationship between HCV seropositivity and previous blood transfusion but intra-unit spread is also known to occur and prevalence rates can alter considerably over time even now blood is screened for anti-HCV _ 11 _ In one UK unit 9 of 66 (148) patients on maintenance haemodialysis were found to be anti-HCV positive and in two cases seroconversion was documented by examination of earlier sera Many had had previous blood transfusion median number of eight units) The guestion of the \\'duty of care\\' for those infected as a result of intra-unit spread might be seen as similar to that for those infected as a result of blood transfusion Health care workers 12 _ Health care workers will be at occupational risk of acquiring HCV from infected patients _ The risk appears to lie intermediate between the high risk of acquiring hepatitis B and the low risk of HIV_ It will be higher among certain health care workers such as surgeons _ dentists etc where the risk of exposure is greater _ There has been little work on individual groups in the UK _ Again the NHS may be seen as having a of care for those infected in its service_ Sexual, household and vertical transmission 13 In general perinatal sexual and household transmission are relatively less efficient modes of transmission Transmission may depend upon the concentrations of circulating virus which are generally thought to be low in infected people_ Overall perinatal transmission may be around 58 (this compares with around 90-958 transmission from hepatitis B e-antigen positive mothers to their babies that would occur in the absence of prophylactic therapy) _ Screening of sera derived from GUM clinics show low seroprevalence rates usually only in the order Of 1-28 Homosexuals _ and heterosexuals with multiple partners may be at increased risk of acquiring HCV _ Transmission may occur through sharing razor

directors of haemophilia centres had recommended that patients receiving solvent-detergent products should be immunised against hepatitis A but were concerned about the lack of a licence for use in children JCVI had asked for the advice of the Advisory Group It was agreed that although the risk in the UK was minimal haemophiliacs receiving products prepared by solvent - detergent technology should be immunised against hepatitis A because of the high incidence of pre-existing chronic liver disease in this group and that children with haemophilia could be immunised using a half of the adult dose 6 ) HEPATITIS B AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS AGH 93/3 The issue of this dance had been delayed because of the issue of revised HIV guidance and the need to ensure compatibility between the two documents The definition of exposure prone procedures needed particular attention It was agreed that as each case needed individual consideration_ a simple definition was required _ The definition tabled at the meeting had been accepted by the Expert Advisory Group on AIDS Although it was agreed that the term \"exposure prone was unfortunate_ the tabled document was generally regarded as acceptable Any further comments on this matter were requested to be passed to Dr Gwyneth Lewis at the Department of Health as quickly as possible The implementation letter to accompany the guidance document was considered; this had been prepared by a specially convened NHS Implementation Group Although the Advisory Group was unable to guit\\nchange the contents of the letter the meeting was asked if there were any major problems with the letter It was felt that ingufficient emphasis had been placed on the immunisation of health care workers However , patients health was of first importance and about 59 of acute hepatitis B cases were associated with surgery or transfusion There was some anxiety amongst surgeons on what would happen to those who were found to be carriers or who refused to be immunised _ Provisions for compensation _ particularly when HCWs were moving between jobs _ remained uncertain It was considered that the timetable for implementation was rather tight This would be revised in the light of delays in publishing the guidance No extra funding to implement the recommendations was being made available and the Chairman requested that the need to prioritige public health should be   emphasised_ It was suggested that all doctors needed a resume of the main points of the guidance An article on the new guidelines would be included in the CMO  S Autumn \"Update\" This would provide such a resume and would algo stress the importance of immunisation for the protection of the health care worker _ Comments on the definition of \"exposure prone procedures and on the Implementation Group- 8 letter were requested by 9 and 13 respectively _ 7 ) REPORT OF WORKING GROUP ON HBV DNA TESTING AGH 93/4 Dr Craske told the meeting that the aims of the study were to review and assess current methods ; to obtain a consensus on significant levels of HBV - DNA ; and_ to investigate and make recommendations on the preparation of a standard _ A number of laboratories in the UK had used different HBV DNA assays to test panel of sera; they had produced similar qualitative results although quantitation had been variable It was noted that two standards had originally been planned -one for sensitivity and one for transmission _ A level of 10 appeared to be a suitable standard for sensitivity_ Data on trangmission from mother to child suggested a lower level 5 peg/ml as the cut off point It was recognised that it would be difficult to obtain data to improve our knowledge of levels of HBV DNA associated with transmission _ Further work was continuing on one of the panel samples as the basis for a working standard_ The meeting agreed that this was an excellent piece of work that a DNA standard was necessary and that the Department be asked to support further work_ Estimates of the costs of further work were requested_ 8 ) HEPATITIS B IMMUNISATION QUESTIONS AGH 93/5 In response to the enquiries raised Dr Elliman\\' 9 letter, it was agreed that to give immunisation in the anterolateral thigh produced an excellent response and that to delay the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine (at least up to 12 months) was also acceptable July pg / ml by\\n9) HEPATITIS B AND FOSTERING AGH 93 /6 The main concern regarding hepatitis B and fostering was about emergency fostering of children from Rumania It was agreed that routine immunisation of thoge fostering UK-born children was not necessary_ 10) HEPATITIS B AND C AND RENAL DIALYSIS AGH 93/7 The Rosenheim Report on viral hepatitis and renal dialysis units had reported in 1972 No immunigation against hepatitis B was then available With the introduction of vaccine the question had now to be addressed as to whether complacency with regard to renal dialysis procedures had set in Rosenheim therefore needed revisiting In the meantime_ useful studies on hepatitis C were being undertaken in the renal dialysis unit at the Middlesex/ UCH hospital Professor Tedder and Dr Brink _ Arrangements for the control of hepatitis B had also been reviewed _ Dr Brink told the meeting that their recommendations on hepatitis B had yet to be discussed with clinical colleagues Four matters had been considered _ 1 ) Frequency of screening of patients: it was concluded that patients should be screened at least-every 3 months and ideally every month 2 ) Immunisation of patients on dialysis immunisation using a four-dose schedule should be re- introduced despite any sub-optimal immune response (patients were not currently being immunised) 3 ) Dialysis of known HBV+ patients these patients required separate facilities and dedicated machines which were not currently available at the unit 4 ) Staff screening ana immunisation it was considered prudent to exclude all surface antigen positive staff from dialysis units ; it was recognised that this point was rather controversial and needed further discussion 66 patients on long-term renal dialysis had been screened for markers of hepatitis C (HCV) infection; 9 had current HCV infection All seronegative patients were also PCR negative- The various risk factors were assessed and _ after an exhaustive search, the only factor identified had been that of length of time on dialysis There had been two seroconversions ~one of whom had not received any blood products and had no other risk factor for hepatitis C_ This patient appeared to have been infected within the dialysis unit suggesting intra-unit transmission of the disease Anecdotal reports from other RD units supported these findings After thorough investigation of the dialysis machines it appeared unlikely that were involved in transmission and some type of direct spread appeared to be taking place The possibility of separate dialysis facilities for HCV+ patients was considered but this was not possible as over 10g of patients were HCV+ However_ since re-siting the unit there had been no more transmissions suggesting that more working space and better precautions might be sufficient Separate dialysis would be introduced if there were another case of transmission A screening programme for patients had been introduced at 3 monthly intervals Transaminsases had been discounted as useful for screening purposes as they do not correlate with HCV seropositivity.', 'title': 'C/Hep C JA 418-WQ-Z-1.pdf'}\n"
